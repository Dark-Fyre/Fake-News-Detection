And faced by this increased competition, the smartphone maker is being tipped to come out with a revamped iPhone line-up which will if rumours are to be true could bring with it an all-new three camera set up at the back.\n\nThe Cupertino-based tech giant is expected to announce three new iPhones this year under the iPhone 11 lineup, and at least two of these are pegged to bring with them three cameras at the back. These two will most likely be the successors to the current generation Apple flagships -- the iPhone Xs and Xs Max.\n\nThe leak comes courtesy of trusted Japanese tipster, Mac Otakara who has previously leaked accurate information about Apple products well in advance. As per the blog, these new iPhones from the 2019 line-up is could come with a triple camera system which will be held together in a new square-shaped enclosure in the upper left-hand corner of the phones. The report further adds that the camera system could be very much like the one found on the Huawei's Mate 20 Pro that is comprised of three different lenses -- a regular wide angle lens, telephoto lens, an ultra wide-angle lens, and an LED flash.\n\nWhat gives this report more credibility is the fact that this isn't the first time we are hearing of such a camera system on the upcoming iPhones. Earlier, tipster @OnLeaks too had tweeted renders of an upcoming iPhone sporting a similar camera set up.\n\nBack from September 2019, I bring you the very 1st and very early glimpse at which I guess #Apple will unveil as #iPhoneXI!!! Yes, time has already come to meet the new #iPhone through gorgeous 5K renders made on behalf of new coming Partner @digitindia -> https:\/\/t.co\/b6SxFUS2tx pic.twitter.com\/97jrlTHQ5G \u2014 Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) January 6, 2019\n\nIf indeed true, the inclusion of such a camera set up on the phone will make things pretty interesting for the market as it will give the upcoming iPhones a big boost in their fight against the Android flagships. With the likes of the Galaxy S10 and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the premium flagship segment already has devices that bring more than two cameras on them, and with the likes of Nokia recently announcing the penta-camera setup 9 PureView, it probably is time for Apple to bring out the big guns and join the cameraphone race."},"1":{"0":"\u2018Privacy matters\u2019 in Apple\u2019s latest iPhone ad","1":"Privacy has always been a big part of Apple\u2019s marketing pitch, and the company is bringing that point home once again in its latest iPhone ad, which boldly declares \u201cPrivacy. That\u2019s iPhone,\u201d via MacRumors.\n\n\u201cIf privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on,\u201d says the commercial, as it flips through a wide range of privacy-related scenarios, including \u201ckeep out\u201d signs, people avoiding eavesdroppers at diners, window locks, curtains, and padlocks.\n\n\u201cPrivacy. That\u2019s iPhone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a similar approach to the massive billboard that Apple bought at CES 2019 earlier this year, declaring \u201cWhat happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone,\u201d in a veiled shot at competitors like Google that were presenting just across the street.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the timing of Apple\u2019s new privacy-focused ad push to consider \u2014 just a few weeks after the news broke of a huge FaceTime bug that would allow anyone to listen in on calls made through Apple\u2019s platform. The incident has since been patched, but it was undeniably a black eye for the company, one that Apple seems eager to put behind it with this new campaign that looks to reinforce that privacy is still a big priority."},"2":{"0":"Apple's Entry-Level iPhone Cancellation Makes Little Sense","1":"Apple has some unusual upgrades planned for its 2019 iPhones, but it is the moves the company is making with models on sale that are turning heads most. And the latest decision really surprises me\u2026\n\nThe Economic Times reports that Apple will increase iPhone prices and cancel the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - the entry level iPhone model still sold widely around the world (including in the US) and used as a cheap gateway into the Apple ecosystem. This will leave the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the bottom rung and, in India, $72 will be added to their prices.\n\nThe logic: \u201c[Apple] wants to reinforce the brand's 'premiumness' in the Indian market and increase average selling prices,\" said one industry executive speaking to The Economic Times.\n\nUpdate: March 15 - Apple India has reached out to clarify that the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will be 5,000 rupees more expensive than the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, but their prices will not increase. The company made no comment on the future of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. ET has also updated its story to reflect this.\n\nDoubling down on this, The Economic Times reports Apple will pull iPhones from any retailers smaller than 350-400 square feet in size. Apple will then focus on a fewer number of larger stores and push them to be Apple-exclusive.\n\nAll of which is the complete opposite of Apple\u2019s strategy to increase iPhone sales in another 1BN+ country: China. Here Apple is slashing prices (often multiple times) and inviting more partners to resell iPhones.\n\nAnd running two opposing strategies simultaneously hints at one obvious concern: Apple doesn\u2019t know how to turn around stalling iPhone sales. Tip: making it more expensive to buy an entry-level phone won\u2019t help.\n\nWith Apple\u2019s next-generation iPhones also hampered by court-battles which could delay the adoption of 5G until 2021, it\u2019s a testing time for the previously imperious company. Yes, we all know Apple has a truly game-changing iPhone starting to take shape, but the immediate road ahead looks rocky\u2026\n\n___\n\nFollow Gordon on Twitter, Facebook and Google+\n\nMore On Forbes\n\nApple's iPhone 5G Problems Set To Continue Into 2020\n\nApple Leak Details Surprising iPhone 11 Display Upgrades\n\nApple's Foldable New iPhone Is Coming Together\n\nApple 'Confirms' iPhone 7, iPhone 8 Hardware Changes\n\niPhone 11 Leak Claims Slow Charging, High Prices Remain"},"3":{"0":"Stanford Medicine announces results of unprecedented Apple Heart Study","1":"Stanford Medicine today reported results of the Apple Heart Study , the largest study ever of its kind, which enrolled over 400,000 participants from all 50 states in a span of only eight months. Apple and Stanford created the study to evaluate Apple Watch\u2019s irregular rhythm notification, which occasionally checks the heart's rhythm in the background and sends a notification if an irregular heart rhythm appears to be suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AFib). As part of the study, if an irregular heart rhythm was identified, participants received a notification on their Apple Watch and iPhone, a telehealth consultation with a doctor and an electrocardiogram (ECG) patch for additional monitoring.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to work with Stanford Medicine as they conduct this important research and look forward to learning more about the impact of Apple Watch alongside the medical community,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s COO. \u201cWe hope consumers will continue to gain useful and actionable information about their heart health through Apple Watch.\u201d\n\nStanford Medicine researchers presented their findings today at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 68th Annual Scientific Session and Expo.

What\u2019s gone wrong? Ryan Vlastelica reports:\n\nApple Inc. is expected to wait until 2020 before it releases a 5G version of its iPhone, but even with a time frame that puts a potential launch after rivals such as Samsung, Apple may still struggle to get the necessary components to build the product. According to [Industry Analysts], Apple is \u201cin a difficult position\u201d given its reliance on Intel\u2019s modem products, and it has four options to deal with the situation, \u201cnone of which is ideal.\u201d\n\nRead more on the four options at Bloomberg.\n\nFalling Demand For New iPhones\n\nBefore the new handsets are launched, Apple still has six months with the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max on sale around the world as the lead handsets. Unfortunately sales and demand in the key territory of China continue to fall. I look at the issues here:\n\nAlthough Apple is slowly moving towards a revenue model that focuses on software and services that transition will take time, and the lion\u2019s share of revenue and profit comes from hardware sales in general and the iPhone in particular. With US and European markets effectively saturated, growth in China and the other BRIC territories is a vital bridge from Apple\u2019s current financial hardware first business model. That's not going well.\n\nWhy not? I explain in more detail here on Forbes.\n\nNew Launches Confirmed By Apple\n\nGiven everyone already had the date in their calendar, Apple\u2019s confirmation of an event on March 25th is not strictly speaking news, but a confirmation. Nevertheless we\u2019re still awaiting an exact breakdown of what will be launched. But we can have a good guess, so over to Andrew Griffin at The Independent:\n\nApple is gearing up for one of its biggest events of the year \u2013 but there won't be any traditional products on the way. The company is hosting the world's media for an announcement at the end of March, during which it will reveal its latest launches. But those launches won't be the traditional shiny slabs of glass and metal. Instead, they'll be subscription services, allowing people to get content over the internet.\n\nApple has also announced the broad details of this year\u2019s developer conference, WWDC 2019:\n\nApple today announced it will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose from June 3 through June 7 at the McEnery Convention Center. Now in its 30th year, Apple\u2019s biggest event will bring together the world\u2019s most innovative and creative developers\u2026 Developers can apply for tickets today through March 20 at 5 p.m. PDT through the WWDC website. Tickets are issued through a random selection process, and developers will be notified of their application status by March 21 at 5 p.m. PDT.\n\nMore details on how to attend WWDC at Apple.\n\nAs well as updating the rollout of Apple News to new territories and four new animoji, the iOS 12.2 packs in a number of new features. The latest beta improves those new features. Juli Clover reports:\n\nThe software introduces support for AirPlay 2 and HomeKit on third-party TVs in light of recent AirPlay 2 announcements, with a new option for limiting TV access joining the speaker access option in the Home app. There's also a redesigned TV remote in Control Center, and when paired with tvOS 12.2, you can ask Siri to play specific TV shows, movies, and music on your HomeKit devices like the Apple TV.\n\nMore at MacRumors.\n\niPad Mini Update Looks To Be A Bit Boring\n\nThrough the medium of a third-party case accessory, we now have a very good idea of what a new iPad Mini will look like. Unfortunately it looks like Apple is updating very little of the design, Killian Bell explains what\u2019s on offer:\n\nThey suggest the new iPad mini will look exactly like its predecessors, with all buttons and ports in the same places. The only difference is a relocated rear-facing microphone. The case, if genuine, quashes suggestions that the new iPad mini will offer four speakers, a Smart Connector, and an LED camera flash.\n\nThere is a silver lining: It looks like the new model will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nMore at Cult Of Mac.\n\nAnd Finally\u2026\n\nApple\u2019s AirPods are small, fashionable, but suffer from physics\u2026 which means the batteries in those purchased by first adopters have lost the majority of their endurance. And to replace the batteries under warranty repair is $49 per pod. That\u2019s 63 percent of the cost of a new pair at $159. It\u2019s even crazier when you note the out of warranty battery replacement is $138. Oh and the charging case has its own battery, and yep, it\u2019s the same cost to replace. William Gallagher reports on the madness:\n\nSince the AirPods die whenever one of the two batteries does, we need to replace both. That\u2019s immediately a $98 total charge or 60 percent of the cost of buying a new pair. If you're forced to dole out the $69 per bud, that isn't tipping the math in your favor. \u2026 new case plus replacement AirPods is likely to cost around the same as a new pair. In which case, you'll be better off buying a new set and keeping the old one as a spare.\n\nMore at Apple Insider.\n\nApple Loop brings you seven days worth of highlights every weekend here on Forbes.

Moreover, Japanese blog Mac Otakara has insisted the product will largely retain the same design as its predecessor, meaning it will have noticeable bezels on its top and bottom, via MacRumours. The iPad Mini has been a hugely popular product for Apple and an update would clearly be welcomed by fans of this smaller tablet. Along with this new iPad, it's also thought the US technology firm could finally bring a wireless charging case to its AirPods. These in-ear headphones already get a boost when placed in their case but this clever power pack has to then be refilled via a wired connection.\n\nSamsung has just released its new Galaxy Buds which include this wire-free technology and Apple are unlikely to want to be left behind for long.

While the specs vary somewhat, they benefit from Apple\u2019s A12 Bionic chip that can handle intensive games, thanks in part to its 6-core CPU (central processing unit) and 4-core GPU (graphics processing unit).\n\nAs big as 6.5 inches on the iPhone XS Max, the larger, very immersive displays on these devices can produce vibrant color, deliver vibrations as feedback, and loud stereo audio, too.\n\nApple's iPhone XS Max, left, and XS (Photo: Apple)\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s cameras also unlock magical augmented reality experiences, which fuse the physical world with a digital one (see below).\n\nThere are several accessories available to enhance your gaming experience including wireless controllers, Bluetooth speakers and headphones, battery packs, special cases and stands.

From our earliest days, we\u2019ve built our devices, software and services to help artists, musicians, creators and visionaries do what they do best.\n\nSixteen years ago, we launched the iTunes Store with the idea that there should be a trusted place where users discover and purchase great music and every creator is treated fairly. The result revolutionized the music industry, and our love of music and the people who make it are deeply engrained in Apple.\n\nEleven years ago, the App Store brought that same passion for creativity to mobile apps. In the decade since, the App Store has helped create many millions of jobs, generated more than $120 billion for developers and created new industries through businesses started and grown entirely in the App Store ecosystem.\n\nAt its core, the App Store is a safe, secure platform where users can have faith in the apps they discover and the transactions they make. And developers, from first-time engineers to larger companies, can rest assured that everyone is playing by the same set of rules.\n\nThat\u2019s how it should be. We want more app businesses to thrive \u2014 including the ones that compete with some aspect of our business, because they drive us to be better.\n\nWhat Spotify is demanding is something very different.

At the same time, they distribute the music you love while making ever-smaller contributions to the artists, musicians and songwriters who create it \u2014 even going so far as to take these creators to court.\n\nSpotify has every right to determine their own business model, but we feel an obligation to respond when Spotify wraps its financial motivations in misleading rhetoric about who we are, what we\u2019ve built and what we do to support independent developers, musicians, songwriters and creators of all stripes.\n\nSo we want to address a few key points:"},"9":{"0":"This week\u2019s top stories: iPhone privacy ad, March 25th event confirmed, WWDC registration, more","1":"In this week\u2019s top stories: Apple makes its March 25th event official and confirms WWDC dates, Spotify takes on Apple, Apple\u2019s new iPhone privacy ad, and more.

And faced by this increased competition, the smartphone maker is being tipped to come out with a revamped iPhone line-up which will if rumours are to be true could bring with it an all-new three camera set up at the back.\n\nThe Cupertino-based tech giant is expected to announce three new iPhones this year under the iPhone 11 lineup, and at least two of these are pegged to bring with them three cameras at the back. These two will most likely be the successors to the current generation Apple flagships -- the iPhone Xs and Xs Max.\n\nThe leak comes courtesy of trusted Japanese tipster, Mac Otakara who has previously leaked accurate information about Apple products well in advance. As per the blog, these new iPhones from the 2019 line-up is could come with a triple camera system which will be held together in a new square-shaped enclosure in the upper left-hand corner of the phones. The report further adds that the camera system could be very much like the one found on the Huawei's Mate 20 Pro that is comprised of three different lenses -- a regular wide angle lens, telephoto lens, an ultra wide-angle lens, and an LED flash.\n\nWhat gives this report more credibility is the fact that this isn't the first time we are hearing of such a camera system on the upcoming iPhones. Earlier, tipster @OnLeaks too had tweeted renders of an upcoming iPhone sporting a similar camera set up.\n\nBack from September 2019, I bring you the very 1st and very early glimpse at which I guess #Apple will unveil as #iPhoneXI!!! Yes, time has already come to meet the new #iPhone through gorgeous 5K renders made on behalf of new coming Partner @digitindia -> https:\/\/t.co\/b6SxFUS2tx pic.twitter.com\/97jrlTHQ5G \u2014 Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) January 6, 2019\n\nIf indeed true, the inclusion of such a camera set up on the phone will make things pretty interesting for the market as it will give the upcoming iPhones a big boost in their fight against the Android flagships. With the likes of the Galaxy S10 and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the premium flagship segment already has devices that bring more than two cameras on them, and with the likes of Nokia recently announcing the penta-camera setup 9 PureView, it probably is time for Apple to bring out the big guns and join the cameraphone race."},"11":{"0":"\u2018Privacy matters\u2019 in Apple\u2019s latest iPhone ad","1":"Privacy has always been a big part of Apple\u2019s marketing pitch, and the company is bringing that point home once again in its latest iPhone ad, which boldly declares \u201cPrivacy. That\u2019s iPhone,\u201d via MacRumors.\n\n\u201cIf privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on,\u201d says the commercial, as it flips through a wide range of privacy-related scenarios, including \u201ckeep out\u201d signs, people avoiding eavesdroppers at diners, window locks, curtains, and padlocks.\n\n\u201cPrivacy. That\u2019s iPhone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a similar approach to the massive billboard that Apple bought at CES 2019 earlier this year, declaring \u201cWhat happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone,\u201d in a veiled shot at competitors like Google that were presenting just across the street.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the timing of Apple\u2019s new privacy-focused ad push to consider \u2014 just a few weeks after the news broke of a huge FaceTime bug that would allow anyone to listen in on calls made through Apple\u2019s platform. The incident has since been patched, but it was undeniably a black eye for the company, one that Apple seems eager to put behind it with this new campaign that looks to reinforce that privacy is still a big priority."},"12":{"0":"Apple's Entry-Level iPhone Cancellation Makes Little Sense","1":"Apple has some unusual upgrades planned for its 2019 iPhones, but it is the moves the company is making with models on sale that are turning heads most. And the latest decision really surprises me\u2026\n\nThe Economic Times reports that Apple will increase iPhone prices and cancel the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - the entry level iPhone model still sold widely around the world (including in the US) and used as a cheap gateway into the Apple ecosystem. This will leave the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the bottom rung and, in India, $72 will be added to their prices.\n\nThe logic: \u201c[Apple] wants to reinforce the brand's 'premiumness' in the Indian market and increase average selling prices,\" said one industry executive speaking to The Economic Times.\n\nUpdate: March 15 - Apple India has reached out to clarify that the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will be 5,000 rupees more expensive than the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, but their prices will not increase. The company made no comment on the future of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. ET has also updated its story to reflect this.\n\nDoubling down on this, The Economic Times reports Apple will pull iPhones from any retailers smaller than 350-400 square feet in size. Apple will then focus on a fewer number of larger stores and push them to be Apple-exclusive.\n\nAll of which is the complete opposite of Apple\u2019s strategy to increase iPhone sales in another 1BN+ country: China. Here Apple is slashing prices (often multiple times) and inviting more partners to resell iPhones.\n\nAnd running two opposing strategies simultaneously hints at one obvious concern: Apple doesn\u2019t know how to turn around stalling iPhone sales. Tip: making it more expensive to buy an entry-level phone won\u2019t help.\n\nWith Apple\u2019s next-generation iPhones also hampered by court-battles which could delay the adoption of 5G until 2021, it\u2019s a testing time for the previously imperious company. Yes, we all know Apple has a truly game-changing iPhone starting to take shape, but the immediate road ahead looks rocky\u2026\n\n___\n\nFollow Gordon on Twitter, Facebook and Google+\n\nMore On Forbes\n\nApple's iPhone 5G Problems Set To Continue Into 2020\n\nApple Leak Details Surprising iPhone 11 Display Upgrades\n\nApple's Foldable New iPhone Is Coming Together\n\nApple 'Confirms' iPhone 7, iPhone 8 Hardware Changes\n\niPhone 11 Leak Claims Slow Charging, High Prices Remain"},"13":{"0":"Stanford Medicine announces results of unprecedented Apple Heart Study","1":"Stanford Medicine today reported results of the Apple Heart Study , the largest study ever of its kind, which enrolled over 400,000 participants from all 50 states in a span of only eight months. Apple and Stanford created the study to evaluate Apple Watch\u2019s irregular rhythm notification, which occasionally checks the heart's rhythm in the background and sends a notification if an irregular heart rhythm appears to be suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AFib). As part of the study, if an irregular heart rhythm was identified, participants received a notification on their Apple Watch and iPhone, a telehealth consultation with a doctor and an electrocardiogram (ECG) patch for additional monitoring.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to work with Stanford Medicine as they conduct this important research and look forward to learning more about the impact of Apple Watch alongside the medical community,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s COO. \u201cWe hope consumers will continue to gain useful and actionable information about their heart health through Apple Watch.\u201d\n\nStanford Medicine researchers presented their findings today at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s 68th Annual Scientific Session and Expo.

What\u2019s gone wrong? Ryan Vlastelica reports:\n\nApple Inc. is expected to wait until 2020 before it releases a 5G version of its iPhone, but even with a time frame that puts a potential launch after rivals such as Samsung, Apple may still struggle to get the necessary components to build the product. According to [Industry Analysts], Apple is \u201cin a difficult position\u201d given its reliance on Intel\u2019s modem products, and it has four options to deal with the situation, \u201cnone of which is ideal.\u201d\n\nRead more on the four options at Bloomberg.\n\nFalling Demand For New iPhones\n\nBefore the new handsets are launched, Apple still has six months with the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max on sale around the world as the lead handsets. Unfortunately sales and demand in the key territory of China continue to fall. I look at the issues here:\n\nAlthough Apple is slowly moving towards a revenue model that focuses on software and services that transition will take time, and the lion\u2019s share of revenue and profit comes from hardware sales in general and the iPhone in particular. With US and European markets effectively saturated, growth in China and the other BRIC territories is a vital bridge from Apple\u2019s current financial hardware first business model. That's not going well.\n\nWhy not? I explain in more detail here on Forbes.\n\nNew Launches Confirmed By Apple\n\nGiven everyone already had the date in their calendar, Apple\u2019s confirmation of an event on March 25th is not strictly speaking news, but a confirmation. Nevertheless we\u2019re still awaiting an exact breakdown of what will be launched. But we can have a good guess, so over to Andrew Griffin at The Independent:\n\nApple is gearing up for one of its biggest events of the year \u2013 but there won't be any traditional products on the way. The company is hosting the world's media for an announcement at the end of March, during which it will reveal its latest launches. But those launches won't be the traditional shiny slabs of glass and metal. Instead, they'll be subscription services, allowing people to get content over the internet.\n\nApple has also announced the broad details of this year\u2019s developer conference, WWDC 2019:\n\nApple today announced it will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose from June 3 through June 7 at the McEnery Convention Center. Now in its 30th year, Apple\u2019s biggest event will bring together the world\u2019s most innovative and creative developers\u2026 Developers can apply for tickets today through March 20 at 5 p.m. PDT through the WWDC website. Tickets are issued through a random selection process, and developers will be notified of their application status by March 21 at 5 p.m. PDT.\n\nMore details on how to attend WWDC at Apple.\n\nAs well as updating the rollout of Apple News to new territories and four new animoji, the iOS 12.2 packs in a number of new features. The latest beta improves those new features. Juli Clover reports:\n\nThe software introduces support for AirPlay 2 and HomeKit on third-party TVs in light of recent AirPlay 2 announcements, with a new option for limiting TV access joining the speaker access option in the Home app. There's also a redesigned TV remote in Control Center, and when paired with tvOS 12.2, you can ask Siri to play specific TV shows, movies, and music on your HomeKit devices like the Apple TV.\n\nMore at MacRumors.\n\niPad Mini Update Looks To Be A Bit Boring\n\nThrough the medium of a third-party case accessory, we now have a very good idea of what a new iPad Mini will look like. Unfortunately it looks like Apple is updating very little of the design, Killian Bell explains what\u2019s on offer:\n\nThey suggest the new iPad mini will look exactly like its predecessors, with all buttons and ports in the same places. The only difference is a relocated rear-facing microphone. The case, if genuine, quashes suggestions that the new iPad mini will offer four speakers, a Smart Connector, and an LED camera flash.\n\nThere is a silver lining: It looks like the new model will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nMore at Cult Of Mac.\n\nAnd Finally\u2026\n\nApple\u2019s AirPods are small, fashionable, but suffer from physics\u2026 which means the batteries in those purchased by first adopters have lost the majority of their endurance. And to replace the batteries under warranty repair is $49 per pod. That\u2019s 63 percent of the cost of a new pair at $159. It\u2019s even crazier when you note the out of warranty battery replacement is $138. Oh and the charging case has its own battery, and yep, it\u2019s the same cost to replace. William Gallagher reports on the madness:\n\nSince the AirPods die whenever one of the two batteries does, we need to replace both. That\u2019s immediately a $98 total charge or 60 percent of the cost of buying a new pair. If you're forced to dole out the $69 per bud, that isn't tipping the math in your favor. \u2026 new case plus replacement AirPods is likely to cost around the same as a new pair. In which case, you'll be better off buying a new set and keeping the old one as a spare.\n\nMore at Apple Insider.\n\nApple Loop brings you seven days worth of highlights every weekend here on Forbes.

Moreover, Japanese blog Mac Otakara has insisted the product will largely retain the same design as its predecessor, meaning it will have noticeable bezels on its top and bottom, via MacRumours. The iPad Mini has been a hugely popular product for Apple and an update would clearly be welcomed by fans of this smaller tablet. Along with this new iPad, it's also thought the US technology firm could finally bring a wireless charging case to its AirPods. These in-ear headphones already get a boost when placed in their case but this clever power pack has to then be refilled via a wired connection.\n\nSamsung has just released its new Galaxy Buds which include this wire-free technology and Apple are unlikely to want to be left behind for long.

And this doesn\u2019t include iPads, which also run on the iOS platform.\n\n\u201cThere are 900 million iPhones out there, only around 300 million consoles, so it is clearly the biggest base of gamers,\u201d confirms Michael Pachter, research analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cNo individual console has ever had an installed base of 200 million.\u201d\n\nThere are several reasons for the iPhone\u2019s popularity among gamers, maintains Pachter, including accessibility, convenience, a huge variety of free-to-play games, and short duration game sessions. \u201cIt has all of the obvious advantages,\u201d he adds.\n\nGaming on your PC?: Check out these 6 accessories you need to score\n\n'The Division 2': Tom Clancy video game brings a battered Washington, D.C., to life\n\nYou might argue comparing an iPhone to a home console is apples to oranges (pardon the pun), as a smartphone isn\u2019t a dedicated gaming system \u2013 it\u2019s also used for calls, messaging, photos, GPS, web browsing, productivity apps, and so on \u2013 but according to Statista, more than 50 percent of smartphone users game on their device.\n\nPlus, while the Android operating system has a bigger overall install base than iOS worldwide, there isn\u2019t just one manufacturer of Android devices, therefore Apple\u2019s iPhone claim is valid.\n\nAlso trailing the iPhone: the 700 million or so shipped personal computers that run Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system, according to estimates from tech site Neowin.\n\nA closer look at iPhone's handle on video games\n\nThere are three devices on the market today: iPhone XR (from $749), iPhone XS (from $999) and iPhone XS Max (from $1099). While the specs vary somewhat, they benefit from Apple\u2019s A12 Bionic chip that can handle intensive games, thanks in part to its 6-core CPU (central processing unit) and 4-core GPU (graphics processing unit).\n\nAs big as 6.5 inches on the iPhone XS Max, the larger, very immersive displays on these devices can produce vibrant color, deliver vibrations as feedback, and loud stereo audio, too.\n\nApple's iPhone XS Max, left, and XS (Photo: Apple)\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s cameras also unlock magical augmented reality experiences, which fuse the physical world with a digital one (see below).\n\nThere are several accessories available to enhance your gaming experience including wireless controllers, Bluetooth speakers and headphones, battery packs, special cases and stands.

If you've already beaten all 544 levels of Candy Crush Saga, try Candy Crush Soda Saga, just launched by King, the maker of the app. Available for free on Amazon, Android, Apple iOS, and Facebook.

We want more app businesses to thrive \u2014 including the ones that compete with some aspect of our business, because they drive us to be better.\n\nWhat Spotify is demanding is something very different. After using the App Store for years to dramatically grow their business, Spotify seeks to keep all the benefits of the App Store ecosystem \u2014 including the substantial revenue that they draw from the App Store\u2019s customers \u2014 without making any contributions to that marketplace. At the same time, they distribute the music you love while making ever-smaller contributions to the artists, musicians and songwriters who create it \u2014 even going so far as to take these creators to court.\n\nSpotify has every right to determine their own business model, but we feel an obligation to respond when Spotify wraps its financial motivations in misleading rhetoric about who we are, what we\u2019ve built and what we do to support independent developers, musicians, songwriters and creators of all stripes.\n\nSo we want to address a few key points:"},"19":{"0":"This week\u2019s top stories: iPhone privacy ad, March 25th event confirmed, WWDC registration, more","1":"In this week\u2019s top stories: Apple makes its March 25th event official and confirms WWDC dates, Spotify takes on Apple, Apple\u2019s new iPhone privacy ad, and more. Read on for all of this week\u2019s top stories.\n\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\n\nOn Monday, Apple confirmed its March 25th event, inviting press to Steve Jobs Theater. The event invitation clearly alludes to the focus on Apple\u2019s streaming vide service, with the company using the tagline \u201cIt\u2019s show time.\u201d There\u2019s also a film-inspired countdown and spotlight on the Apple logo.\n\nIn addition to confirming its March event, Apple this week also confirmed the dates for its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The event will take place from June 3rd through June 7th in San Jose, California at the McEnery Convention Center. Registration for the opportunity to buy a $1599 ticket to the conference is open until March 20th.\n\nApple on Thursday launched its latest privacy-focused advertisement for the iPhone. This time, the company makes privacy extremely relatable \u2013 like comparing it to public bathroom etiquette, eavesdropping, and more. View the ad here.\n\nSpotify this week filled a complaint with the European Commission about the App Store. Spotify says that Apple is giving itself an \u201cunfair advantage at every turn\u201d and cites grievances such as the 30% cut Apple takes. Apple responded by saying Spotify wants \u201call the benefits of a free ap without being free.\u201d\n\nApple continued its wide-ranging legal battle with Qualcomm this week. In one of the cases, related to Qualcomm\u2019s royalty tactics, a judge came down on Apple\u2019s side in a preliminary ruling. In a patent infringement case, however, a jury sided with Qualcomm and ruled that Apple owes the chip maker $31 million.\n\nThese and the rest of this week\u2019s top Apple stories below\u2026\n\niOS | macOS | tvOS | watchOS |\n\niPhone |\n\nMac + iPad |\n\nTop Apple stories, retail |\n\nApple Watch |\n\nAirPods |\n\nApps |\n\nQualcomm v Apple |\n\nApple News + Video |\n\nTop Apple stories, company |\n\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac\u2019s YouTube channel for more videos.\n\nThis week\u2019s top videos |\n\nHappy Hour Podcast #215 |\n\nThis week Benjamin and Zac are joined by Mark Gurman to discuss Apple\u2019s upcoming March 25th event, WWDC 2019, and Apple\u2019s AR\/VR headset plans, plus Apple vs Spotify, Amazon Fire TV gaining Apple Music, a new HomeKit lamp review, and more.\n\n9to5Mac Happy Hour is available on iTunes and Apple\u2019s Podcasts app, Stitcher, TuneIn, Google Play Music, or through our dedicated RSS feed for Overcast and other podcast players.\n\nhttps:\/\/9to5mac.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2019\/03\/9to5Mac-Happy-Hour-03-14-2019.mp3\n\nStacktrace Podcast #027 |\n\nIt\u2019s time for some new, alternative, avenues of spelunking \u2014 including Apple\u2019s career website, and\u2026 Rambo\u2019s digital life?
